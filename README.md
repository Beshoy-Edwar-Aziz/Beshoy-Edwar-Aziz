I'm a full stack web developer using Angular framework for front end and .Net Core for developing back end.
I came to master various languages like JavaScript, TypeScript and C#. I'm currently planning for learning a lot of different things but mainly now, I'm looking forward to learning PHP and to start developing WordPress sites.
